# Springboard Data Science

Over 600 hours of hands-on course material, with 1:1 industry expert mentor
oversight, and completion of 2 in-depth portfolio projects. Intensive course in Python, SQL, data wrangling, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and machine learning.

I also completed the _Advanced Machine Learning_ specialization track, which covers popular areas of Machine Learning (NLP, Computer Vision, Recommendation Systems, Network Analysis), Deep Learning and common Neural Network architectures, scaling up models, working with big data, and containerizing and deploying machine learning models. 

## Topics

1) Data Wrangling

2) SQL & Databases

3) Statistics for Exploratory Data Analysis

4) Supervised Learning

5) Unsupervised Learning

6) Feature Engineering

7) Data Storytelling

8) Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
